# SpellChecker

Ron Weasley decides to take his MacBook out and develop an app to impress Hermione Granger with his innate knowledge of spells. He wouldn't dare to develop it without automated tests, of course. Much less without BDD scenarios.

## Getting started

TBD

## FAQ

- **I noticed that Cucumberish hasn't been updated in a while. Why did you pick it instead of another solution like Quick?**

In plain terms, Cucumberish is the simplest, most direct implementation that I've found of BDD for iOS and I like it this way. Other solutions seem to structure things differently and I've elected to keep using Cucumberish, even with its annoyances, because of how straightforward it is when it comes to organizing test scenarios.

## Reference

Cucumberish, our framework of choice for parsing BDD Feature files: https://github.com/Ahmed-Ali/Cucumberish

A guide for the test scenario syntax supported by Cucumberish (Gherkin): https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/ (Notice that this guide applies not only to Cucumberish but also to any other BDD framework used in conjunction with any other language - e.g., Java.)
